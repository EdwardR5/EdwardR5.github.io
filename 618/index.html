        Critical Annotated Bibliography: <br />Distanced Learning; The New Norm
      </h1>
      <p class="text-center">
        The Novel Coronavirus of 2019, or Covid for short, caused the entire
        world to reevaluate our system of Education. Despite the idea of a
        vaccine going around, there is a possibility that distanced learning may
        become a norm, or at least a part of a new post-covid world. With that
        in mind, we may have to be mindful and consider the possibility that,
        once Covid is done, we may still have to continue with the option of
        distanced learning. Therefore, it's important that we analyze and
        recognize some of the problems related to distanced learning. However,
        at the same time, we can propose some solutions to help make distanced
        learning more equitable for all.

                Overview:<br />
                In Kumashiro's piece, he looks at how different schools around
                the US have been affected by the Novel Coronavirus of 2019, or
                Covid for short. At one point, Kumashiro discusses how
                "technology can enhance education, but the misuse of or
                over-reliance on technology can exacerbate existing resource
                inequalities between schools and even between homes,
                particularly for students in poverty, homeless students, and
                students with disabilities" (pg. 2). Kumashiro looks at the
                various problems that have arisen due to distanced learning and
                the challenges that come with it. Kumashiro also analyzes the
                negative effects of distanced learning on students across the
                United States.

                Evaluation:<br />
                Because of how inequitable education already is, distanced
                learning can exacerbate that inequity. Students aren't able to
                fully collaborate with one another, as students would be
                communicating via a screen the entire time. This shift can cause
                more harm as students would be required to do more work outside
                of class, rather than within the classroom and collaborating
                over a project together.

                Overview:<br />
                In Love's piece, Love analyzes how the Novel Coronavirus of
                2019, or Covid for short, changed the way of education within
                the United States. Various educational institutions moved away
                from an emphasis on standardized testing, instead focusing on
                the wellbeing of students. Love explains that at the beginning
                of the Pandemic, in the "state of Georgia, the state's school
                superintendent issued a letter to teachers and parents calling
                for "compassion over compliance" as we all try to reach students
                during a pandemic. In mid-April, Atlanta's superintendent moved
                the district to a four-day teaching schedule. Teachers are to
                use Fridays for professional development and to be available to
                students who are behind. We need that same energy,
                understanding, and creativity from our school leaders when
                schools reopen" (pg 1). All of this to show how schools
                positively adapted to the change caused by Covid. At the same
                time, this positive change does have its negative aspects too.
                Love states, "I see the possibilities for an education system
                now forced to trust teachers, give students autonomy, and rely
                on the ingenuity of parents. I also see the loss of schools as
                places of refuge, safety, family services, and invaluable social
                interactions" (pg. 2). With the loss of physical school and a
                shift towards virtual school, the needs have changed. Love
                reminds the reader that even after the pandemic, we cannot go
                back to the pre-Covid system, and we must continue to prioritize
                the health and wellbeing of our students.

                Once schools reopen and life goes back to some normality within
                a post-covid world, we, as educators, must remember the benefits
                that came with the Covid period of Education. Some of the
                downsides are prevalent and important to recognize. However, as
                we eventually move into a Post-covid world, we have to try to
                merge the benefits of both pre-Covid and intra-Covid periods for
                Education. This merge would look like continuing to pay
                attention towards the wellbeing of our students, not
                prioritizing standardized testing, however, keeping the
                resources of our schools open to supply that refuge that Love
                talks about.

                discusses the positive and negative effects of technology, while
                this one discusses how technology like social media can be used
                to help share stories for good. In a sense, this article would
                showcase how the world works beyond just technology, and human

                Delpit's piece discusses the importance of the process approach
                compared to simply getting answers. Delpit emphasizes that,
                "child-centered, whole language, and process approaches are
                needed in order to allow a democratic state of free, autonomous,
                empowered adults, and because research has shown that children
                learn best through those methods" (p 31). These three primary
                approaches – child-centered, whole language, and process
                approach – are key in providing stronger education for students
                as they help build students up and provide the space for
                students to feel empowered with their education.

                The emphasis on child-centered, whole language, process
                approaches are key, as it provides the space for students to be
                in a problem-posing classroom. In terms of a distanced learning
                classroom, these are even more important. Getting the answers
                nowadays is simple courtesy of the Internet and the vast
                information database out there, however, it is important to know
                how to get the information we need to know. Breaking down issues
                is incredibly important and thinking through the process to get
                a solution to a problem is even more important.

                Regardless of which curriculum I'm teaching, whether that's
                Computer Science or Mathematics, I do believe that the process
                is more important than simply getting the answer. With Computer
                Science and Programming, there are almost always multiple ways
                to get the same outcome. We have different methods for writing a
                single algorithm, some are more efficient than others –
                sometimes this efficiency comes at a cost of writing far more
                code. This resource would be used to showcase why its important
                to think through the process rather than jumping straight to an
                answer, which is incredibly important for both Computer Science
                and Mathematics.

                Moll, Amanti, Neff, & González formed a study looking at how
                households can influence and help students in classrooms. Moll,
                et al. were "particularly interested in how families develop
                social networks that interconnect them with their social
                environments, and how these social relationships facilitate the
                development and exchange of resources, including knowledge,

                The study done by Moll et al showcases how important the
                lifestyle at home is towards the education of an individual.
                With distanced learning, it's important for us to recognize that
                some households are more inequitable than others. The households
                of some students may house more problems than those of others
                and it's important to really understand this. As we go into a
                potential post-covid world, the lifestyle at home will continue
                to impact the education of our fellow students and peer
                teachers. Therefore it's important to respect the households and
                help when we can.

                As students come from varying households with varying
                perspectives and experiences, it's important for students to
                also understand that the lives we live at home will bleed into
                our educational environments. I think regardless of the
                curriculum, in the earlier days, I'd have my students read this
                as I believe it can help build that empathetic connection
                between students. That empathetic connection can help build the
                community and provide a space for students to really understand
                how different life is per person. This has less to do with any
                specific curriculum, and more to do with helping students build
                that empathy between one another.

                Overview:<br />
                Ayers' work focuses around how important it is to value
                students, where we teach "for justice and care" as the title
                suggests. Ayers' looks at how we, as educators, can create the
                space for students to feel cared for and listened to. Ayers'
                suggests that "engagement, thoughtfulness, connectedness,
                valuing youngsters as third-dimensional beings with their own
                hopes, dreams, and capacities to build upon–these are the basics
                in teaching toward democracy and justice and care" (p 18).
                Ayers' looks at the various directions in which we can support
                our students, building up our students to feel valued and cared
                for, which ultimately help them want to pay attention and learn
                in our classrooms.

                In creating the space for our students to feel valued, we also
                generate the space for our students to want to go to school and
                learn, as they feel welcomed and, again, valued. The feeling of
                being important and valuable transcends education and connects
                with some of our basic needs, according to Maslow, of needing to
                be valued. In creating the space for our students, our students
                would want to return to our classrooms and get the most out of
                their education. This is important as their education will help
                build their character and careers. With distanced learning, we
                have our limitations, but we can still help foster these types
                of classrooms with our approach towards teaching.

                When it comes to usage, this is also important for the field of
                Computer Science. Our users, ultimately, are human beings. If we
                can make our users feel welcomed and valued, then they would
                generally return to our service. In one of the units of
                Practical Usage of Computer Science, I plan to hold a lesson
                touching on Psychological aspects where we look at the
                importance of making our users feel as though they matter – as
                they do.

                Nieto's discusses her experience in classrooms where culture
                isn't focused on. Nieto analyzes the various aspects important
                to effective education, such as the way one views learning.
                Nieto states, "how one views learning leads to dramatically
                different curricular decisions, pedagogical approaches,
                expectations of learning, relationships among students,
                teachers, and families, and indeed, educational outcomes" (pg
                5). Nieto emphasizes the approach one takes towards education as
                that is one of the major influences towards effective education.

                How one views education serves as a major influence as some
                would view it as a means to learn, while others may see it as a
                mandatory part of life since those around them are telling them
                to attend school. For some, education is meaningless, for
                others, it may mean a lot. Striking that balance is difficult
                but important, but for students, understanding why they're in
                school is incredibly important. Nieto's piece looks from a
                teaching perspective, but can also be used to help students
                understand their own reasons for education.

                Understanding our why is more important than our what and how.
                In the case of Computer Science and Computer Science education,
                sometimes its important to remember why we started. This piece
                would be introduced earlier in the year and returned to
                throughout the curriculum to remind students why they started.
                That purpose can change throughout the course, but hopefully, it
                can help drive students to keep going with their goals. Computer
                Science is difficult, that is true. However, when we have a
                purpose or a reason to learn, it can be become less frustrating
                and more rewarding.
