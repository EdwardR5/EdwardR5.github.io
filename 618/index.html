        Critical Annotated Bibliography: <br />Distanced Learning; The New Norm
      </h1>
      <p class="text-center">
        The Novel Coronavirus of 2019, or Covid for short, caused the entire
        world to reevaluate our system of Education. Despite the idea of a
        vaccine going around, there is a possibility that distanced learning may
        become a norm, or at least a part of a new post-covid world. With that
        in mind, we may have to be mindful and consider the possibility that,
        once Covid is done, we may still have to continue with the option of
        distanced learning. Therefore, it's important that we analyze and
        recognize some of the problems related to distanced learning. However,
        at the same time, we can propose some solutions to help make distanced
        learning more equitable for all. In the context of Computer Science
        education, we can always analyze the effects of a pre and post covid
        world. The hopes of this critical annotated bibliography is to dive into
        how various resources can better aid education with a focus on Computer
        Science education.

                Overview:<br />
                Bin Abid writes about various means that individuals can utilize
                their Computer Science and programming skills during the Covid19
                Pandemic. Bin Abid discusses three primary means that
                individuals can spend their time; E-Learning, Freelancing, and
                Product-Based Solutions. These means describe how the
                coronavirus affects all, but individuals are still able to spend
                their time applying their knowledge in Computer Science.

                Bin Abid's writing helps individuals understand how their time
                can be used, primarily in the field of Computer Science.
                Computer Science is only one means that an individual can spend
                their time, but Bin Abid focuses on how effective it can be,
                with a number of methods one can approach it. This allows the
                reader to consider other ways to keep learning and improving
                their understanding of Computer Science, in a simple and easy
                manor. In relation to an article written by Kevin Kumashiro on
                how covid has effected a lot of aspects of the world, Kumashiro
                states, "technology can enhance education, but the misuse or or
                over-reliance on technology can exacerbate existing resource
                inequalities between schools and even between homes,
                particularly for students in poverty, homeless students, and
                students with disabilities" (pg 2). Bin Abid's article doesn't
                help the disadvantaged, but rather provides options for those
                who already have options.

                Considering I would be teaching Computer Science, in theory, I
                would have a lesson in which I ask students to come up with ways
                they could continue their education outside of the classroom.
                There is also a constant question out there with anyone about
                where to start and what should one do with programming. This
                resource provides a succinct explanation about what one can do,
                but with an emphasis on the covid situation.

                Overview:<br />
                The University of Nebraska-Lincoln, or UNL for short, writes
                about how to implement inclusive excellence into virtual
                learning environments. In their writing, UNL outlines the
                various primary methods and means that they use to make
                education in virtual environments more accessible for their
                students. The primary principles UNL discusses are: "Balancing
                Synchronous & Asynchronous Learning, Transparency, Academic
                Belonging, Accessibility, Flexibility, and Attentiveness" (UNL,
                2020). These primary methods are further explained about how
                they can be utilized within various other places, without
                emphasizing what UNL as a University is already doing.

              <p class="evaluation" id="Inclusion_evaluation">
                Evaluation:<br />
                The various methods UNL bring up are important to recognize as
                they are the key factors that can aid in affective virtual
                learning. As Education itself possibly shifts towards an online
                norm, keeping certain principles in mind is important. If a
                system forgets these principles, virtual education may struggle
                to be effective for the majority. The various principles also
                highlight how educators can keep their education accessible
                despite the challenges and limitations that come with virtual
                learning. Again, in relation to Kevin Kumashiro's piece on how
                Covid has affected the world, Kumashiro states, "technology can
                enhance education, but the misuse or or over-reliance on
                technology can exacerbate existing resource inequalities between
                schools and even between homes, particularly for students in
                poverty, homeless students, and students with disabilities" (pg
                2). UNL offers ways in which we can provide a more accessible
                means of education for our students, fully acknowledging that
                there are downsides to virtual education.

                Usage:<br />
                Less of an individual lesson, but keeping in mind that syllabus'
                will be key, along with general rules of engagement within
                classrooms, this resource would be used to provide a reason for
                certain ways of learning. Balancing between Synchronous and
                Asynchronous learning would be a key point for my classroom, as
                I do believe that some work can be done asynchronously. Not all
                work can be done asynchronously though, as some concepts would
                have to be taught in a synchronous setting, however, I do
                believe students can work together and learn well together.
                Therefore small optional group projects could be used. Generally
                speaking, this resource would mainly be used to serve as a
                baseline reason for the two methods of teaching.

                In the article titled "Teaching from my Kitchen Table: Education in Trying Times", the Global Women's Health Technologies staff, or GWHT Staff for short, describe two interviews with two women. They focus on how their teaching has changed due to the ongoing Covid situation. In the interviews, the two females are asked about their experiences in moving from teaching in person to teaching virtually.

                The perspectives of both females showcase the various changes that have had to happen due to Covid and the move towards virtual education. The responses provide a perspective as to how education really changed for everyone when the Coronavirus came. The resource provides a space for individuals to have a comparison as to how life changed for everyone, especially educators. In terms of Virtual Learning, it provides a look into the other ways that virtual learning can occur, outside of the immediate classroom. Because it shows the perspectives of others, it allows for students to see how other people have been affected outside of themselves. As Camangian states, "varying  levels  of  perceived  differences  shape  much  of  the tensions that manifest between young people" (pg 180). Considering many are going through similar emotions and feelings during this period, when individuals see that they aren't so different from one another, that their experiences are shared, that tension can decrease. In doing so, students can better collaborate and work together, even if it is virtual and through the screen.

                In a lesson on how life has changed because of Covid, along with how Computer Science has been affected, an assignment may be to search for stories and anecdotes from others on how their lives have been changed. At the same time, the resource may serve as an individual key example as to how technology has also impacted the lives of those affected – in both good and bad ways.

                For everyone starting into Computer Science, the question of what language should I learn always comes up. There are a number of different perspectives stating different languages, but Veeraraghavan chooses 7 specific languages and dives into why each is beneficial for one to learn.Often times the response is to learn a single language, and the rest will make more sense from there. Similarly to the process approach described, by Delpit as, "proposed in part that teachers should focus more on the larger cognitive processes of writing than solely on correcting the products" (pg 7), to understand how to program, a lot of it is down to the process of learning syntax and logic. It is less important to memorize exactly how a single programming language works, and more important to understand the core logic and basics of a language, which would then allow for other programming languages to make more sense. Despite how subjective the choices are, Veeraraghavan provides a perspective as to some of the languages that are really useful to learn, especially now. In the context of virtual learning, this helps as it provides students with a perspective on programming languages and why they're helpful, this would normally be an entire lecture in the beginning, but the lecture can be shortened by using this resource, since time becomes far more valuable in a virtual setting. The resource can be used to prefix the concept of many languages along with the pros and cons to those languages, which would be a discussion point in a regular class, but may not be possible virtually due to time constraints. At the same time, it can be used within a discussion board to look at how languages are used.

                In the beginning of the semester, this resource amongst a couple others can be used to describe various programming languages, along with why we're choosing the one we're using in the classroom. If it's an AP Computer Science class, the resource can be used to describe how other languages are more preferred, but the language chosen by the AP board would help establish the logic for other languages. On the other hand, if it is a general programming course, the resource can be used to explain why a specific language was chosen. As explained also in the evaluation portion, the resource can be used as a prefix towards a lecture on programming languages, to better save time. Furthermore, it can be used as a discussion post prompt, for students to read through and discuss programming languages as a whole..

                In Baldwin's review of CodingBat, he describes what CodingBat is, the general structure, the interface, the tutorial steps, and pros and cons for the platform. Each description breaks down why CodingBat is helpful for an individual who wants to improve their understanding of Java.

                Baldwin's descriptions are generally subjective, but again provide a perspective into how useful the resource of CodingBat is. CodingBat serves as a programming practice problem site. It provides problems for Java, which can then be used for anyone learning the language. CodingBat as the primary resource is described as a form of practice, but that can be a form of informal assessment too. As Atkin states, "both informal and formal classroom assessment procedures are seen everywhere as teachers work with students and as students work with each other. Together, they serve several purposes: to help students learn, to illustrate and articulate the standards for quality work, to inform teaching, and to provide a basis for reporting concrete accomplishments to parents" (pg 98). As CodingBat provides practice problems, this informal assessment procedure can be used to provide students with a way to collaborate and learn together, allowing for teachers to better understand where their students are at. This is especially useful in the context of virtual learning as providing homework that provides feedback immediately can help students feel engaged, even if it goes through a platform. At the same time, for teachers, if students are in their 'classroom', they can see where the student is at, and can then work closer with the student, should they need additional help.

                Usage:<br />
                In general, CodingBat would be used as a resource for practice problems. Baldwin's review, in particular, would be used to explain why CodingBat is useful and being used within the classroom setting. Because an AP Computer Science classroom (at least currently) teaches Java, CodingBat and, by extension, Baldwin's review serve as a platform and description for practice problems. Within an introductory programming course, most would use Python, which if that is the case, CodingBat can also be used for practice problems. Because the platform of CodingBat serves both Python and Java, Baldwin's review can also be used to help clear up confusion for Python learners with why the resource is helpful.

                Overview:<br />
                Urie describes Imposter Syndrome for Programmers, breaking it down and providing means for programmers to get over their imposter syndrome. He breaks down the reasons for why one may feel the syndrome, then goes into details with recommendations as to how to move past the feelings from imposter syndrome. Each recommendation connects back to how imposter syndrome affects the individual and how each recommendation is helpful for that specific affect.

                When starting to program, many individuals don't feel good enough or generally feel the influence of imposter syndrome. This can easily prevent individuals from continuing and pursuing their education in programming, or continuing in the field of programming. Urie describes each point with evidence as to how it can help an individual with imposter syndrome using his own perspective of going through it himself. For many, this can provide some strategies and some general comfort into not falling into the mindset brought by imposter syndrome. As stated by Ayers, "Engagement, thoughtfulness, connectedness, valuing youngsters as third-dimensional beings with their own hopes, dreams, and capacities to build upon–these are the basics in teaching toward democracy and justice and care" (pg 18). When individuals, especially our students feel they aren't alone and that they can get through their struggles, they will then start to work together more and want to work. In the context of virtual learning, this piece would be especially important considering individuals don't get to see each other in person, and may only see the work that is being produced. This would mean that they may not see how much their peers are struggling and may think that their peers are miles ahead of them, when the reality is, that they may be on even footing.

                Throughout the curriculum, this resource would be a constant reminding resource that it is okay to struggle, it is okay to feel what we're feeling, but that we can move past it. By providing a resource that inspires hope and provides recommendations as to how to avoid imposter syndrome, hopefully students wouldn't feel deterred when they see themselves behind their peers. This resource would be posted within the syllabus and would be required for students to read through at least once to remind them that what they are feeling is valid, that they aren't alone, and, most importantly, that it can be resolved.
