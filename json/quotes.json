Honestly, I don't know how you've dealt with me and my problems for so long because there is a lot, some of which are very much repeated...actually, all of them are very much repeated, so kudos to you<‚ù§Ô∏è I also don't know how you've managed to come to basically all of my performances in the past two years.

As I wasn't familiar to the whole American high school system at first, it took a toll on me and I didn't balance out my courses in high school, which results in senior year being filled with very intense courses. I was overwhelmed by all the workload and pressure throughout the year, but I lied to myself and kept it from my friends and family by saying that I was okay. I guess that's one of the reasons I started drifting away from all my friends, I wasn't happy with my performance in classes and I thought maybe just taking my social part away would help the situation, but it got worse and I started getting very depressed and helpless. But even then, you still support me and make sure that I was doing just fine. And that really meant a lot to me, just knowing that you're always there when I needed help. I honestly don't know what would've happened if you weren't actually there for me in my senior year.\nTo be honest, I really hated high school, but you really made it a better place. I hope you know that I will be there if you need someone to talk, and I hope we keep in contact. Thank you for the past three years, I'm looking forward for more years to come ‚ù§Ô∏è"

I wanna start off by saying thank you. You're not only one of the most generous, empathetic, and extremely wise person I know, but truly one of my closest friends. I honestly don't know how I would've survived these past few months if it wasn't for your help and all the advice you gave me. I was completely broken after the summer and battling depression / panic attacks were one of the hardest things I had to experience, and knowing you'd support me no matter what helped me so much. I have so much respect for ya and I really just want the best for you. I know you're gonna fact a lot more challenges in the future, but know that you're never alone and Christine and I will always be by your side, I promise you. Just like you said to us, you're not defined by the experiences you went through, it's who you become afterwards that matters the most. I've gone through a lot of friendship problems, a heartbreak, almost through college struggles, and constant parent arguments, if I can go through this, I know you'll be fine. And of course always take it easy. \nHappy New Year and 2020 will be good!\nAll the best, Kathy"

You‚Äôre one of the most intelligent and caring of individuals I‚Äôve ever met, and having you as a roommate to absorb wisdom and knowledge by osmosis has been one of the most beneficial things I‚Äôve encountered in my life. \nThe reason why I trust you and open up is simple; you‚Äôre one of the best people to do that with, in fact it‚Äôs to my detriment not to if I didn‚Äôt. This is not something that can be said for a lot of people, making you rare, very rare indeed. Make sure you never lose your self for whatever reason, because the world needs more people like you, and it often will throw all sorts of obstacles at you to make you lose your way.\nI‚Äôm glad I can serve as a person that reminds you of who you would like to be, and my role in keeping you sharp. Thank goodness I can be myself and serve a useful purpose, because it‚Äôs often I feel that my real self has little value, hence the entire self growth progress this year. You were instrumental in it, I wouldn‚Äôt have achieved it without you and Ravi, and I‚Äôm grateful.\nAnd likewise, it‚Äôs been an awesome year of growth! Let‚Äôs tackle the next one serving our respective roles, and may we never forget who we would like to be in the process.\nHappy new decade Edward, and here‚Äôs to meaningful and successful years going ahead!"

Without you dude, I realy would have no idea whetehr I'd have gone through the first semester of college intact with the emotional turmoil caused by life and a certain flower....\n\nI've often cited why I look up to you but I'm doing it again lah. Your competence, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma are like someone rolled 20s in a d20 dice during charactercreation beofre a campaign, though I know they're forged by fire in your early experienced in life. I hope you're doing alright emotionally because holy crap man, you bring so much good to others.\n\nI'm glad to have met you. It's really just like the movies. Now I hope both the mentor and the student can get what they want instead of the classic mentor dying off and passing the torch or something like that (Obi Wan, Count of Monte Cristo), I'd want better faces for us than that.\n\nHappy new year from Indonesia."

I was embarrassed, ashamed and frankly fed-up with the person I was. When I came to HK, I thought it would be a fresh start, but I never really got that until we became friends. You were the person that I judged myself by, and honestly, if I hadn't done that, I don't know where I'd be at all today. I never knew what I could be. I had no idea that I was an empath, I had no idea what my passions were, I had no idea of who I was. All I wanted to do was be something new, and our friendship is what motivated me to never give up. I never would've imagined that we'd both be where we are now, but despite everything along the way, I couldn't be happier to call you my best friend. My brother. My soulmate. I love you so much ed, when everyone and everything is falling apart, I know you'll always be there. There's no amount of text, no gesture grand enough, no words, to express how truly grateful I am to you. So thank you too ‚ù§Ô∏è and I love you so much"

Even though I haven't been your baby sis for long, I wantedC to say thank you for being my big bro. During interim, you were the one that I could go to if I had trouble. You have already done so so so so much for me that idk what I would do without you in my life. Whenever I think about how hard my life is, I always think of breaking down and I always go to you because you always somehow manage to talk me out of whatever I want to do to myself. I'm really happy that you are my big bro because I can go to you for advice or just general help. I wish you were my actual big bro sometimes because you treat me so well. I always wonder what life would be like if I died... I always wondered if my friends would miss me or be sad and then forget me... you have taught me so much already and I can't thank you enough. I don't mind the long passages because I feel like you are the only one who understands me and how I feel. I hope you get better big bro!! Love you so much!! ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è"

You always manage to see the best in me even when I can't see it myself. Tbh, I have no idea what I'm gonna do in the future without you? You've alway sbeen so supportive of everything(and tbh, idk how you do o it). Thanks for listening and dealing with my banter/rants! I know it's hard to deal with me but you make it work!

    "quote": "Dear big bro,\nI know you are wondering what this is and hold on because I'm about to tell you. In mindfulness, we watched a video on the science of happiness and while watching it, I was thinking of you because whatever I go through, you are always there to support me. I just wanted to take the time and write, or in this case say it to you, because I wanted to let you nkow. Here it goes: Thank you for being there for me when I needed someone. Thank you for making me smile even when I didn't want to. Thank you for helping me restore my confidence that I still have yet to find. I told you I believe everything happens for a reason and this is one case wehre I think that that statement is most applicable, that being because I could not be more thankful to have such a caring big brother in my life. Even though you've known me since I was 7, I was just your friend's annoying sibling at the time. But fast forward three yeras and we've become so much more. I know I've said this a lot but it is true because I genuinely don't know what I would do without you. Without them, I would be my directionally challenged self trying to get by life. Thank you for checking in with me everyday to make sure I am doing/trying to do better than Christine okay or Christine fine. I know I've said this before but thank you for being my big brother, thank you for havign my back, thank you for being there for me. I know I don't say this all the time, or enough come to think of it, but I really do appreciate having you in my life. You've been there for every one of my performances in the past two years and you still manage to calm me down on the other side of the world. You've really made me question and reflect on my life choices in the past three yeras because I know for a fact that if I, hypothetically, ended my life (which I won't), then you would be the most impacted by it. I definitely wouldn't be me without you. I know I'm just rambling but, and if you haven't gotten the point of this yet, thank you for being there for me no matter what and I love you so much! ‚ù§Ô∏è You know you can talk to me abou tanything, anytime.\nLove you,\nLove, baby sis."

    "quote": "Dear Edward,\nI know it's been a while since I last gave you a letter but I thought that it was time I gave you another. First of all, I wanted to say thank you so much for being my big brother. I actually don't know what I'd do without you...Not gonna lie, I'd be more directionally challenged than ever! You've stuck by my side since Freshman year and I can't ever thank you enough. I started out as your friends annoying little sister when we met (when I was just a mere child at the age of 7), but now, I've become your little sister and I wouldn't change it for the world. You've never failed to do a dailly check in for three yeras and I realised that I should've done it as well, but me being me, that kinda fell short. Thank you for being here for me when I needed someone. I know it's definitely not easy to listen to my 24 million problems but you make it work and I'm very grateful and truly amazed. I can truly say that you are the one person who has helped me grow so much (as a person lol not literally). I know that no matter where you are, you'll always support me ‚ù§Ô∏è. You help me be more open to how I feel about shit, whether it's useless or not, and I know that I can tell you anything without you hardcore judging me. We've been through so much in the past three yeras and it's really helped with out closeness and our bodnd as siblings. Of all my close friends, you are the ONE person I rant to about literallye anything. Thank you for being so trustworthy because without you, I would still have trust issues. Three years have gone by and I don't know how many mental/actual breakdowns I've had, but you've experienced or unconciously experienced my pain. I know you mentioned this in th eletter you gave me at the beginning of the year but when you had your health scare, I was so so so so so so worried that I was gonna lose you. I definitely wasn't ready to lose you at that point. In fact, I don't think I'll ever be ready to lose you. It's been almost a year since you graduated and I've literally missed seeing you in the mornings and squishing my cheeks. Thank you for actually watching my long ass snapchat videos and accepting my various memes. Words cannot describe how much I love having you in my life. I've been knocked down so many times, and it's been quite easy as I am a smol hooman being but you've always reminded me to get back up and be so much stronger than I was before,. I wknow how hard it must be to be everyone's guidance counselor but here's where my advice comes in. I know you love to help people with their issues, BUT you can't be there for everyone 24/7, and I know that, which is why I try to limit how much I go to you because I don't want to add to how much stress you have. You have to remember that you can't help everyone all the time and that you need to take breaks for yourself every once in a while. I know you've had a rocky couple of weeks but you've done so well on pushing through like you taught me. In the end, lol idk, I was tryna sound deep, but whoops that obviously failed. Everything I've done in the past couple of years, I've done with you in mind (besides when I'm breaking down). I wanted to say thank you. Thank you for being the reason I can trust people (especially guys) again. Thank you for being the reason I am able to get closer to others. Anyway, thank you for being the best big brother and believing in me when I didn't., I'm so lucky to have you in my life. I LOVE YOU. \nLove,‚ù§Ô∏è\nYour directionally challenged baby sister aka Thing 2 akak Younger Lee\nPS: I don't like that I have to share you with other people. NOT FAIR AT ALL üòî"

Thank you for putting all of your heart and effort into making this an amazing experience for everyone who participated. You stepped up every day and everyone walked away feeling cared for, listened to, and valued. It's not easy to lead like this but you have a natural way of doing it, so I hope that you will find opportunities to continue in the future.\n\nI couldn't believe how hard everyone worked throughout the entire week! You were doing every task, encouraging everyone to work hard through your example and warm conversations. And of course you smile, which you wore throughout the week.\nI can't tell you how pleased I was to go on this experience with you and to see you blossom and help others blossom.\nYour aunt must be so proud to watch you do what you did.\nBest,\nMrs. Chi and Mr. Canham"
