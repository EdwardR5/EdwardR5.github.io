You may or may not be wondering what the purpose of this letter is (idk...up to you) and honestly, idk either. This letter will probably be me just ranting about how grateful I am to have you as an older brother. First of all, I would like to say thank you! Not only for being there for me for the past couple of years, but for also taking care of me. Words can't explain how grateful I am for such a considerate, supportive, and caring older brother.\n*Disclaimer:This letter will have no order/type of organisation whatsoever so this will be a mess but you're used to that as you have been dealing with me for a while.\n\nWe've known of each other's existence for 9 years (so since I was 7? idk) but we've gotten closer over the last two, which I feel is sad. Honestly, I don't know how you've dealt with me and my problems for so long because there is a lot, some of which are very much repeated...actually, all of them are very much repeated, so kudos to you<<3 I also don't know how you've managed to come to basically all of my performances in the past two years. You've really encouraged me to continue performing and helping me to remember to BREATHE!\n\nYou help me feel needed and loved when I needed to the most. (I can't English...but that's nothing new). You've constantly reminded me that I have a reason to live for the long period of time that I've known you for, you've constantly made sure that I was doing okay. You've helped so many people and you deserve all the recognition that you get, I'm gonna end this letter here by saying a couple of words.\n\n-I'm gonna miss you like crazy\n-idk what I'm gonna do w/o you\n-I'm so lucky to call you my older brother\nand finally...I love you more than words can say and CONGRATULATIONS!

As I wasn't familiar to the whole American high school system at first, it took a toll on me and I didn't balance out my courses in high school, which results in senior year being filled with very intense courses. I was overwhelmed by all the workload and pressure throughout the year, but I lied to myself and kept it from my friends and family by saying that I was okay. I guess that's one of the reasons I started drifting away from all my friends, I wasn't happy with my performance in classes and I thought maybe just taking my social part away would help the situation, but it got worse and I started getting very depressed and helpless. But even then, you still support me and make sure that I was doing just fine. And that really meant a lot to me, just knowing that you're always there when I needed help. I honestly don't know what would've happened if you weren't actually there for me in my senior year.\nTo be honest, I really hated high school, but you really made it a better place. I hope you know that I will be there if you need someone to talk, and I hope we keep in contact. Thank you for the past three years, I'm looking forward for more years to come <3"

He has become such a strong support system for myself, and many others, that the bond between us has become something like that of siblings. \nAlthough I’ve met many people throughout they years, no one compares to Edward. That is why he has become a role model for myself.\nHis love for people is something I envy. I still don’t understand how someone can be so compassionate. Being there for people in a supportive way is what Edward does better than anyone I have ever met. \n\nEdward always goes out of his way to help others even when he is facing challenges of his own. He puts others in front of himself because he is always seeking to lessen the pain of others.\nEdward is the perfect applicant.

I mean it <3 Also isn't it just so interesting how we became friends? Lol, I just randomly texted you because for some reason I trusted you even though we didn't know each other that well. And you, super duper kind and amazing, listened to me and helped me even when you were going through some tough times. Wow. Ahhh I can write a whole essay about how thankful I am but we also live inside of time hehe so I'm going to stop there for now <3 <3"

Your wisdom and intelligence (or competence, as I'd personally like to think recently) also set standards for the kind fo person I aspire to be. When I first met you and interacted, I looked at you with jealousy, then respect, envy, and finally inspiration. You forced me to grow and changed how I think, and that's been crazy valuable.\n\nYou still have a lot to teach me and I'm eager to learn, and if along the way I can help you, I'd be bloody glad. So yeah, thanks for being you as well. You bring good to everyone around you, so continue being the Yoda you are (and I hope I don't end up like Dooku). See you around!"

Without you dude, I realy would have no idea whetehr I'd have gone through the first semester of college intact with the emotional turmoil caused by life and a certain flower....\n\nI've often cited why I look up to you but I'm doing it again lah. Your competence, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma are like someone rolled 20s in a d20 dice during charactercreation beofre a campaign, though I know they're forged by fire in your early experienced in life. I hope you're doing alright emotionally because holy crap man, you bring so much good to others.\n\nI'm glad to have met you. It's really just like the movies. Now I hope both the mentor and the student can get what they want instead of the classic mentor dying off and passing the torch or something like that (Obi Wan, Count of Monte Cristo), I'd want better faces for us than that.\n\nHappy new year from Indonesia."

Even though I haven't been your baby sis for long, I wantedC to say thank you for being my big bro. During interim, you were the one that I could go to if I had trouble. You have already done so so so so much for me that idk what I would do without you in my life. Whenever I think about how hard my life is, I always think of breaking down and I always go to you because you always somehow manage to talk me out of whatever I want to do to myself. I'm really happy that you are my big bro because I can go to you for advice or just general help. I wish you were my actual big bro sometimes because you treat me so well. I always wonder what life would be like if I died... I always wondered if my friends would miss me or be sad and then forget me... you have taught me so much already and I can't thank you enough. I don't mind the long passages because I feel like you are the only one who understands me and how I feel. I hope you get better big bro!! Love you so much!! <3 <3"

Even you were busy, you still made sure to get to me and make sure I was doing okay <3 <3\n....\nthis might not happen to everyone but I am definitely afraid of the unknown. One way that I've dealt with it is just to breathe (just as you taught me) and let it happen. Sometimes the outcome is great and sometimes it's not. I believe everything happens for a reason and so don't be afraid <3 <3 \n...\nawww you've helped me so much and taught me so many things. One of them being to always breathe and slow down. I know my advice sucks sometimes (sometimes being most of the time) but to the people that I care about most, I try my ěry best to help back <3 Looking back at my journey and the people who helped me come out of my shell, you are definitely the person at the top of the list <3 <3 I've always focused on the negatives but you helped me to see the positives (even though sometimes there are no positives), you pushed me to try and find them. You don't get the credit you deserve which is sad because you've helped countless people"

Whenever I was feeling shitty, (which is pretty much every day), you always made sure to double-check on me. (Even if you were super busy). You always manage to see the best in me even when I can't see it myself. Tbh, I have no idea what I'm gonna do in the future without you? You've alway sbeen so supportive of everything(and tbh, idk how you do o it). Thanks for listening and dealing with my banter/rants! I know it's hard to deal with me but you make it work! You've always made me feel like I'm / my life iworth living (and I'm lowkey crying right now). I'm glad, wait no... grateful as shit that you were on my first Interim <3 We've been close for about two years and we already have so many memories <3 You already encourage me enough by speaking, but when you text it/ take the extra time, it lowkey makes me cry everytime. This is gonna be it for now, you'll get another one of these (maybe longer) when you graduate! Love you <3 \n love, \n lil sis <3"

    "quote": "Dear big bro,\nI know you are wondering what this is and hold on because I'm about to tell you. In mindfulness, we watched a video on the science of happiness and while watching it, I was thinking of you because whatever I go through, you are always there to support me. I just wanted to take the time and write, or in this case say it to you, because I wanted to let you nkow. Here it goes: Thank you for being there for me when I needed someone. Thank you for making me smile even when I didn't want to. Thank you for helping me restore my confidence that I still have yet to find. I told you I believe everything happens for a reason and this is one case wehre I think that that statement is most applicable, that being because I could not be more thankful to have such a caring big brother in my life. Even though you've known me since I was 7, I was just your friend's annoying sibling at the time. But fast forward three yeras and we've become so much more. I know I've said this a lot but it is true because I genuinely don't know what I would do without you. Without them, I would be my directionally challenged self trying to get by life. Thank you for checking in with me everyday to make sure I am doing/trying to do better than Christine okay or Christine fine. I know I've said this before but thank you for being my big brother, thank you for havign my back, thank you for being there for me. I know I don't say this all the time, or enough come to think of it, but I really do appreciate having you in my life. You've been there for every one of my performances in the past two years and you still manage to calm me down on the other side of the world. You've really made me question and reflect on my life choices in the past three yeras because I know for a fact that if I, hypothetically, ended my life (which I won't), then you would be the most impacted by it. I definitely wouldn't be me without you. I know I'm just rambling but, and if you haven't gotten the point of this yet, thank you for being there for me no matter what and I love you so much! <3 You know you can talk to me abou tanything, anytime.\nLove you,\nLove, baby sis."

    "quote": "Dear Edward,\nI know it's been a while since I last gave you a letter but I thought that it was time I gave you another. First of all, I wanted to say thank you so much for being my big brother. I actually don't know what I'd do without you...Not gonna lie, I'd be more directionally challenged than ever! You've stuck by my side since Freshman year and I can't ever thank you enough. I started out as your friends annoying little sister when we met (when I was just a mere child at the age of 7), but now, I've become your little sister and I wouldn't change it for the world. You've never failed to do a dailly check in for three yeras and I realised that I should've done it as well, but me being me, that kinda fell short. Thank you for being here for me when I needed someone. I know it's definitely not easy to listen to my 24 million problems but you make it work and I'm very grateful and truly amazed. I can truly say that you are the one person who has helped me grow so much (as a person lol not literally). I know that no matter where you are, you'll always support me <3. You help me be more open to how I feel about shit, whether it's useless or not, and I know that I can tell you anything without you hardcore judging me. We've been through so much in the past three yeras and it's really helped with out closeness and our bodnd as siblings. Of all my close friends, you are the ONE person I rant to about literallye anything. Thank you for being so trustworthy because without you, I would still have trust issues. Three years have gone by and I don't know how many mental/actual breakdowns I've had, but you've experienced or unconciously experienced my pain. I know you mentioned this in th eletter you gave me at the beginning of the year but when you had your health scare, I was so so so so so so worried that I was gonna lose you. I definitely wasn't ready to lose you at that point. In fact, I don't think I'll ever be ready to lose you. It's been almost a year since you graduated and I've literally missed seeing you in the mornings and squishing my cheeks. Thank you for actually watching my long ass snapchat videos and accepting my various memes. Words cannot describe how much I love having you in my life. I've been knocked down so many times, and it's been quite easy as I am a smol hooman being but you've always reminded me to get back up and be so much stronger than I was before,. I wknow how hard it must be to be everyone's guidance counselor but here's where my advice comes in. I know you love to help people with their issues, BUT you can't be there for everyone 24/7, and I know that, which is why I try to limit how much I go to you because I don't want to add to how much stress you have. You have to remember that you can't help everyone all the time and that you need to take breaks for yourself every once in a while. I know you've had a rocky couple of weeks but you've done so well on pushing through like you taught me. In the end, lol idk, I was tryna sound deep, but whoops that obviously failed. Everything I've done in the past couple of years, I've done with you in mind (besides when I'm breaking down). I wanted to say thank you. Thank you for being the reason I can trust people (especially guys) again. Thank you for being the reason I am able to get closer to others. Anyway, thank you for being the best big brother and believing in me when I didn't., I'm so lucky to have you in my life. I LOVE YOU. \nLove,<3\nYour directionally challenged baby sister aka Thing 2 akak Younger Lee\nPS: I don't like that I have to share you with other people. NOT FAIR AT ALL :("

Thank you for putting all of your heart and effort into making this an amazing experience for everyone who participated. You stepped up every day and everyone walked away feeling cared for, listened to, and valued. It's not easy to lead like this but you have a natural way of doing it, so I hope that you will find opportunities to continue in the future.\n\nI couldn't believe how hard everyone worked throughout the entire week! You were doing every task, encouraging everyone to work hard through your example and warm conversations. And of course you smile, which you wore throughout the week.\nI can't tell you how pleased I was to go on this experience with you and to see you blossom and help others blossom.\nYour aunt must be so proud to watch you do what you did.\nBest,\nMrs. Chi and Mr. Canham"

    "quote": "Dear Edward\nYes, we are missing you here in HK. Some days are quite quiet and I am working pretty hard to fill in the time. Took mom to the movies, some running around and shopping and generally exploring a bit of Central we have not seen before. It is not actually that different most of the time as you were out with friends, 'me time', etc., but dinners are a new experience without your contributions.\nThat said, YiYi is here and filling up som eof the gap for now. They have been playing tourist to the giant Buddha, transportation day tour, lunches and today is 'photo sorting day' going through the red box. So, for now - all attention is on Justin instead of me... yay for me and I have absolutely no intention to make any noise that changes that dynamic or focus headed in my direction!! I have been ducking out to fly drones, spend time on the balcony to cook, got a new book to hide away and so on. Young Kung is on his own! And this Sunday, I am sailing - rain or shine and BBQ at MI. \n No surprise, we hit your room somewhat on Sunday since it was raining. Basically, we folded your clothes and put drawers, threw away the carpets as old and worn (especially under drums and desk chair) and that's about it. Now I am using your desk and put the printer on your drawers. \nThat allowed mom to generally pack away her work on the dining table daily into the 'box' and also put in your room in the evening - so we moved on and put all the TVs back and had to clean up the living room too.  What a productive an dfun weekend.\nWe started 2 new family projects that will soon consume all of our time, \n1. S+ office and home relocation to Sui Sai Wan. It appears that we may have found a unit that will work for us to buy. So we are now working on the real estate part to understand if it works out and then make an offer. If hthis one works out, we may plan to complete renovation and move in December. THe place is about twice as big as Larvotto and high warehouse ceiling etc. so we will see. \n2. GMa relocation to Friendship village. Yes, she made the decision and bought a new smaller house. So that project and move will happen in Jan (say 9-15) Therefore, mom is the remote designer and I am the remote Project Manager for that. I am planning to make a trip in October and will let you know the details. Anyway, you will sure get a couple of free dinners in SF when I come through. \nWe are hoping you are settling in with some routine yet know it will take a while. So here is some taste from home and morning routine to take to those first classes that are such a long walk from your dorm.\n Love Dad."
