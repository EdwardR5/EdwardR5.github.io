You may or may not be wondering what the purpose of this letter is (idk...up to you) and honestly, idk either. This letter will probably be me just ranting about how grateful I am to have you as an older brother. First of all, I would like to say thank you! Not only for being there for me for the past couple of years, but for also taking care of me. Words can't explain how grateful I am for such a considerate, supportive, and caring older brother.\n*Disclaimer:This letter will have no order/type of organisation whatsoever so this will be a mess but you're used to that as you have been dealing with me for a while.\n\nWe've known of each other's existence for 9 years (so since I was 7? idk) but we've gotten closer over the last two, which I feel is sad. Honestly, I don't know how you've dealt with me and my problems for so long because there is a lot, some of which are very much repeated...actually, all of them are very much repeated, so kudos to you<<3 I also don't know how you've managed to come to basically all of my performances in the past two years. You've really encouraged me to continue performing and helping me to remember to BREATHE!\n\nYou help me feel needed and loved when I needed to the most. (I can't English...but that's nothing new). You've constantly reminded me that I have a reason to live for the long period of time that I've known you for, you've constantly made sure that I was doing okay. You've helped so many people and you deserve all the recognition that you get, I'm gonna end this letter here by saying a couple of words.\n\n-I'm gonna miss you like crazy\n-idk what I'm gonna do w/o you\n-I'm so lucky to call you my older brother\nand finally...I love you more than words can say and CONGRATULATIONS! You've achieved (idk if that's right) so much and I don't want you to give up! <3"

 "quote":"I have known Edward for over 3 years now. Through the years, he has not only become one of my best friends but has also become my role model. Whenever I have a problem, I always know that he’ll be there for me to listen and give me advice. Even when he is busy, he makes time to help me with my problems. He has become such a strong support system for myself, and many others, that the bond between us has become something like that of siblings. \nAlthough I’ve met many people throughout they years, no one compares to Edward. That is why he has become a role model for myself.\nHis love for people is something I envy. I still don’t understand how someone can be so compassionate. Being there for people in a supportive way is what Edward does better than anyone I have ever met. \n\nEdward always goes out of his way to help others even when he is facing challenges of his own. He puts others in front of himself because he is always seeking to lessen the pain of others.\nEdward is the perfect applicant. I am sure he will greatly benefit the program and community to the best of his abilities."

 "quote":"Awww thanks ed. Totally wasn't expecting a message like this. Very touching. It sure is funny how we have become very close even though it was really Geo who introduced me to you. Though maybe it is with good reason. Thanks for hanging with me and watching Rogue One with me too (God damnit Jane). My PC is still named Eick (lul) and I am honoured to be a co-leader of our sailing club :) we should also start on an email for sailing club before we get back."

 "quote":"Hey big bro! <3 \nI know it's been hard for you because you got sick and other things in your life. Even though I haven't been your baby sis for long, I wanted to say thank you for being my big bro. During interim, you were the one that I could go to if I had trouble. You have already done so so so so much for me that idk what I would do without you in my life. Whenever I think about how hard my life is, I always think of breaking down and I always go to you because you always somehow manage to talk me out of whatever I want to do to myself. I'm really happy that you are my big bro because I can go to you for advice or just general help. I wish you were my actual big bro sometimes because you treat me so well. I always wonder what life would be like if I died... I always wondered if my friends would miss me or be sad and then forget me... you have taught me so much already and I can't thank you enough. I don't mind the long passages because I feel like you are the only one who understands me and how I feel. I hope you get better big bro!! Love you so much!! <3 <3"
